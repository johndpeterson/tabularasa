Tabula Rasa was originally developed as a student productivity tracker
for use by the Public Services Department at Pitts Theology Library
at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA by John Peterson
http://github.com/johndpeterson/tabularasa

Original development machine was running PHP7 and MySQL5.6 
using XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Configuration assumes all services hosted on one server.

Original favicon and banner graphic were modified from a woodcut of St. Jerome, part of 
the Pitts Digital Image Archive http://www.pitts.emory.edu/dia

Version 1.0 was originally developed for PHP5 with mysql_ commands and static code.  
Version 1.0 ran flawlessly on a wonderful old Lenovo T60 running Ubuntu Linux LAMP setup 
until an unfortunate water event killed the battery charging system.
A similar laptop was sourced as a temporary measure for a few months and then the system 
was transitioned into a VM running a Red Hat Linux LAMP environment.
Version 2.0 was released for internal use in January 2016 with PDO based MySQL commands 
and static code in preparation for a shift to a PHP7 environment.
Version 3.0 was released on github in February of 2016 with PDO based MySQL commands 
and function based code. Version 3.0 _may_ work on other database environments outside 
of MySQL but was not tested for this functionality.
